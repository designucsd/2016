excerpt: Computer programming is now a vital skill, but millions of people around the world struggle to learn it on their own without being able to get help from a human tutor. To address this significant access gap, I created Python Tutor, a pedagogical code visualization, and social learning system. This talk will describe the Python Tutor visualization platform and three social learning systems built upon it. Taken together, these systems help people around the world learn programming even when they do not have access to scarce in-person tutoring resources.

Computer programming is now a vital skill, but millions of people around the world struggle to learn it on their own without being able to get help from a human tutor. To address this significant access gap, I created Python Tutor, a pedagogical code visualization, and social learning system, which now visualizes code written in seven popular languages: Python, Java, C, C++, Ruby, JavaScript, and TypeScript. So far, over 2.5 million people in over 180 countries have used Python Tutor to visualize over 20 million pieces of code, making it by far the most widely-used system of its kind. This unique scale inspires new types of interactive systems for online learning, along with the ability to evaluate those systems on orders of magnitude more subjects than is possible in traditional lab studies. 

This talk will describe the Python Tutor visualization platform and three social learning systems built upon it: 1.) Codechella enables multiple people to simultaneously write code together, visually explore its run-time state using multiple cursors, and text chat to perform tutoring and collaborative learning. 2.) Codeopticon enables a single tutor to efficiently monitor dozens of learners as they are coding and then step in to offer proactive assistance. 3.) Codepourri enables a crowd of learners to collaboratively generate tutorials even when experts are not present. Taken together, these systems help people around the world learn programming even when they do not have access to scarce in-person tutoring resources.
