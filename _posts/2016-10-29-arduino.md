excerpt: In this hands-on two part event, you’ll get the chance to tackle a design challenge by prototyping with Arduino, an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. (Although no experience working with Arduino is required!) If you like building things or just tinkering around, this event is for you! This is a closed event that requires pre-registration.
