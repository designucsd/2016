## Getting Set Up

If you haven't already done so, find and install a text editor. Here are two I recommend:

* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)

Go ahead and create a folder to hold everything in this workshop. Call it something logical like `HTMLWorkshop` or `LoveDesignatUCSD`. Navigate into that directory and create a file called `index.html` using your new code editor.

Now go ahead and write some words your `index.html`, then navigate to the file in your browser to view it. 

You should see something like this:
```
```

Now go ahead and paste this code into your index.html:
<h2>Example of code</h2>

<pre>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="block two first">
            <h2>Your title</h2>
            <div class="wrap">
            //Your content
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</pre>
